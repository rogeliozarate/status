### A CLI ruby script to check GIT staus in ongoing projects

I wanted a fast, easy hack to check the status of several projects at once.
I did not want gems or extenal dependencies: Pure Ruby, BASH, and GIT.

- Projects are listed in an array
- Sting class is extended to colorize the output (I <3 ruby)

### ToDo
- Put ongoing projects in a separate file

  It will be easier to add/remove a project with a BASH script

- Next iteration will be pure BASH ;)
